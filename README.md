# Jewelry_Manufacturing_and_Store_Management_System
 
Collaborated with an 8-member team to design and develop a comprehensive web application for Diamonds.lk, a jewelry factory and 
shop in Thalawathugoda, for client Mr. Kumara Waduge, providing facilities for both customers and the owner. Utilized the MERN 
stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js) to create a robust and user-friendly platform. Used Postman as a testing tool to 
ensure the service's reliability.
